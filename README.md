Movie Dataset Project with Clickstream Theme
This project aims to analyze a movie dataset with a clickstream theme to gain insights into user behavior, preferences, and engagement. The project focuses on addressing three research questions:
1.	What are the common paths or sequences of movie selections within the clickstream data?
This question focuses on identifying common paths or sequences of movie selections made by users. By analyzing the clickstream data, you can uncover frequently occurring patterns of movie choices, such as users consistently selecting movies from specific genres or following a particular order in their selections. This analysis can provide insights into user behavior and help in improving movie recommendation systems or identifying potential cross-promotion opportunities.
2.	Are there any correlations between viewer ratings and viewer engagement?
Analyze the clickstream data to understand if there is a relationship between the ratings given by viewers and their engagement with movies and shows. Compare the average ratings of highly engaged content with those of less-engaged content. Explore if higher-rated movies and shows tend to have higher engagement levels, indicating a positive correlation between ratings and viewer interest.
3.	How do different genres perform in terms of viewer engagement and ratings?
Utilize the clickstream data to analyze the performance of different genres on Netflix. Identify the genres that receive the highest viewer engagement and average ratings. Determine if certain genres consistently outperform others in terms of viewer interest. Additionally, explore if there are any variations in genre preferences based on user demographics or viewing patterns captured in the clickstream data.
Dataset
The movie dataset used for this project consists of Netflix Movie and TV Show Database, where you can explore ratings and reviews from millions of viewers worldwide! Our database contains information on over 600 movies and TV shows released in the past 15 years. For each title, you can find details such as the title itself, release year, age certification, runtime, genres, production countries/nations, seasons information (if applicable), IMDb score, and votes.
We take pride in offering four unique models that provide an organized view of this extensive dataset. The Best Movie by Year Netflix model utilizes a heuristic criterion of 25k+ votes and presents ordered IMDb scores, allowing you to discover which movies have gained popularity over the years. The Best Show by Year model is a valuable resource for exploring trending content across different nations. The Best Movies Netflix model compiles titles with at least 10 thousand votes and an IMDb score of 6.9+ while prioritizing extreme satisfaction. And if that wasn't enough, we have curated a collection titled 'Best Shows Netflix' that includes titles surpassing 7.5 in IMDb score with 10 thousand reviews or more. This comprehensive package delivers insights for both avid cineastes and casual viewers seeking real-time updates on quality content streaming right away!"
We would like to acknowledge and credit Eduardo Gonzalez as the author of the dataset. The dataset used in this project was created and provided by Eduardo Gonzalez, containing valuable information on over 600 movies and TV shows from the past 15 years.

Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
•	data/: Contains the movie dataset and clickstream data.

Conclusion
This movie dataset project with a clickstream theme aims to provide valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and engagement. By analyzing the clickstream data, we address three research questions related to common movie selection paths, correlations between viewer ratings and engagement, and genre performance. The repository contains code, documentation, and presentation materials to facilitate exploration, replication, and dissemination of the project's findings.
